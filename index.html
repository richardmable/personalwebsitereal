				<p class="hello">Hello, I'm Richard!</p>
				<p>
					I'm a recent graduate of the <a href="http://nycda.com">New York Code and Design Academy</a> in Philadelphia. I enjoy developing the back-end of websites, am interested in health and fitness technology, and enjoy tinkering with the Tessel IO board. I also blog a bit, mostly about problems I come across while coding and how I solve them. You might also see the occasional bike race re-cap in there as well!

			<h1>Portfolio</h1>
			<p class="portfolioDescription">You can find a more detailed discussion of the particular challenges of each project in the blog</p>
			<div class="project3">
				<a href="https://github.com/richardmable/shipping" target="new">Shipping Application</a>
				<p>
					The objective of this project was to create a shipping application that might be used by a shipping company to assign orders, maintain ships, and track routes. The database for this project was the most demanding aspect, taking the better part of two days to accomplish. As one can imagine, there are many, many ways to set up a database for a project like this, depending on how many features one would like to have. Having only 4 days to build the project, we had to learned to compromise, and were very pleased in the result.

			<div class="project4">
				<a href="https://aqueous-beach-4947.herokuapp.com" target="new">BB-8...6 Microblog</a>
				<p>
					A two person group project, this application replicated the general format of Twitter. Challenges for this project included users following each other, limiting the posts to 150 characters, and our first steps towards learning how to validate form information upon submission. It was built with the theme of BB-8, but for bikes, as BB-86 is a bottom bracket type.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project5">
				<a href="https://github.com/richardmable/ruby_ORM" target="new">Ruby ORM (Recreate Activerecord!)</a>
				<p>
					This project's goal was to recreate some of the widely used features of Activerecord, and to become more familiar with SQL commands. The most challenging part of this project was parsing the strings that were returned by psql. A excellent exercise in logical thinking and how to return data as an object, so that methods may be run on the object.
