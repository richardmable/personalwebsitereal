				<p>Hello, I'm Richard!</p>
				<p>
					I'm a recent graduate of the <a href="http://nycda.com">New York Code and Design Academy</a> in Philadelphia. I enjoy developing the back-end of websites, am interested in health and fitness technology, and enjoy tinkering with the Tessel IO board. I also blog a bit, mostly about problems I come across while coding and how I solve them. You might also see the occasional bike race re-cap in there as well!

						If you'd like to know more about me, check out my portfolio to see some of my work, or check out the about page to learn more about what I was doing before I became a web developer. Feel free to contact me with questions or comments at the bottom of the page, and be sure to check out the <a href="http://richardmable.github.io" target="new">blog!</a>

			<h3>You can find a more detailed discussion of how these projects were created by checking out the blog</h3>
			<div class="project">
				<a href="https://github.com/richardmable/shipping" target="new">Shipping Application</a>
				<p>
					This project had us create a shipping application that might be used by a shipping company to assign orders, maintain ships, and chart routes. The database for this project was the most demanding aspect, taking the better part of two days to accomplish. As one can imagine, there are many, many ways to set up a database for a project like this, depending on how many features one would like to have. Having only 4 days to build the project, we had to settle for some compromises, but were very pleased in how it came out, and have continued to improve it since then.
				</p>

			<div class="project">
				<a href="https://aqueous-beach-4947.herokuapp.com" target="new">BB-8...6 Microblog</a>
				<p>
					This application is an attempt to mimmick some of the functions of Twitter. Challenges for this project included users following each other, limiting the posts to 150 characters, and our first steps towards learning how to validate form information upon submission. It was built with the theme of BB-8, but for bikes, as BB-86 is a bottom bracket type.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project">
				<a href="https://github.com/richardmable/ruby_ORM" target="new">Ruby ORM (Recreate Activerecord!)</a>
				<p>
					This project was to recreate some of the widely used features of Activerecord, and to become more familiar with SQL commands. The most challenging part of this project was parsing the strings that were returned by psql. A great exercise in logical thinking and how to return data that is useful, and not just static.
